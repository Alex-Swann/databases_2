# Databases 2: from Domain Models to Database Structures (1h)

### Learning Objectives

1. Explain how to use CRC cards to model a domain
2. Model a simple domain using CRC cards
3. Infer database structure from domain structure

### Starter (15 minutes)

Demonstrate examples of CRC cards (you can use [this example](crc_example.md)). Collaboratively pull a database structure from the CRC cards in the way suggested in [the student readme](README.md).

### Main (30 minutes)

See [the student readme](README.md) for instructions.

### Plenary (15 minutes)

Collaboratively review students' suggested structures.

> Focus more on the database structures than on the CRC modelling.
